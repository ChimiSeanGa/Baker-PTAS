# Baker-PTAS
A polynomial-time approximation scheme for the densest k subgraph problem using Baker's technique.

## Running the program
The program is run as follows:
```
python3 dks_ptas.py [graph adjacency list file] [k value] [epsilon value]
```
Read more about the adjacency list file format [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/adjlist.html).
